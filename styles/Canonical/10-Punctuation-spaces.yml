# Reasoning:
# We appreciate that you may have learnt to put two spaces after a full point/period/full stop.
# There is no need to and very little point. Most documentation parsers remove double-spaces
# anyway. If you want to debate this, please file an issue or hop on to the documentation 
# mattermost channel where someone will be happy to tell you that you are wrong.
